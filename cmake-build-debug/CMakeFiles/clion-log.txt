CMake Warning at submodule/polympc/CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindQPMAD.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "QPMAD", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "QPMAD" with any of
  the following names:

    QPMADConfig.cmake
    qpmad-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "QPMAD" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "QPMAD_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "QPMAD"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.


CMake Warning at submodule/polympc/CMakeLists.txt:17 (message):
  CasADi is not found, the corresponding interface and examples will not be
  built


CMake Warning (dev) at submodule/polympc/src/control/CMakeLists.txt:2 (project):
  Policy CMP0048 is not set: project() command manages VERSION variables.
  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0048" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
  command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  The following variable(s) would be set to empty:

    PROJECT_VERSION
    PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR
    PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR
    PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
